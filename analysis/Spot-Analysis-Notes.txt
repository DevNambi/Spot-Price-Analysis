# Notes

### General Approach

* For each instance type, do spot prices correlate:
    * Across AZs in the same region?
    * Across regions?
    * By UTC time of day? For the same AZ or region?
    * By local time of day? For the same AZ or region?
* For each instance type in a single AZ/region, do discounts correlate
    * By instance category?
    * By instance family?
    * By feature (memory, CPU, SSD, GPU presence)
    * To any other instances?
* Are prices historically stable in an AZ or region?
    * What factors correlate with price increases in the next 24 hours? Prices in a different AZ? Price increases for other instances?


### R Resources

* ARIMA - turns out the closest approach is random-walk mean reverting. Unfortunately. So there's no real pattern.
* Make confusion matrix - each instance and the instances with more resources in each.
